    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. 
        Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to
        Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. The mixture is 
        topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching
        libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks,
         as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar 
         together to release the flavors. But it's well worth it for a 
         refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains 
         one of the most popular to this day.
